This repository is for the paper [arXiv:2510.24121](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24121) by Yao Guo et al., currently under review at The Astrophysical Journal.

It includes a Mathematica notebook, which can be used to solve the linear growth rate of the collisionless shear instability in shear flows subject to a uniform flow-aligned external magnetic field.

The shear flow is assumed to be infinite, uniform in density, and characterized with a symmetrical and discontinuous velocity profile $v_0(x)=V_0\times sgn(x)$.

The shear flow and the perturbation mode is determined by 4 dimensionless parameters $V_0/c$, $\omega_c/\omega_p$, $k_yV_0/\omega_p$ and $k_zV_0/\omega_p$.

The Notebook gives the eigenfrequency (whose imaginary part is the linear growth rate) of the perturbation mode as long as the values of the 4 parameters are assigned.
